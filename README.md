### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ currently working as a project engineer with experience in systems, cloud, scripting, and network engineering/administration. 

Held certifications in A+, Network+, and CCNA Routing & Switching. 

I am looking to get into a more scripting, automation, or programming role. 

My Github profile is organized using organizations based off the programming language being used.
